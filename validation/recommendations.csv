On a daily basis the candidate will provide technical support for a business critical application managing the support tickets and solve the issues within the agreed SLAs. 2. On a daily basis you will monitor the environment health and performance, respond to incidents, restore service after a critical incident, and provide recommendations to improve the supportability and availability. 3.

A DBA must be able to translate a data model or logical database design into an actual physical database implementation and to manage that database once it has been implemented. * Backup and recovery. Implementing robust backup and recovery procedures is the insurance policy of the DBA. The DBA must implement an appropriate database backup and recovery strategy based on data volatility and application availability requirements. * Ensuring data integrity. DBAs must be able to design databases so that only accurate and appropriate data is entered and maintained. To do so, the DBA can deploy multiple types of database integrity including entity integrity, referential integrity, check constraints, and database triggers.

Number of positions:   1 Salary Range:   TBD Job Location:   TBD Job description:   Client is one of the leading global cloud networking provider to multinational clients and is looking for a DBA/Software Support Specialist to join the Operations and Systems team. The successful candidate will be responsible for the day to day operations and maintenance of a business critical ERP application and its underlying systems architecture and database. The candidate has 3 main objectives:   1. On a daily basis the candidate will provide technical support for a business critical application managing the support tickets and solve the issues within the agreed SLAs. 2. On a daily basis you will monitor the environment health and performance, respond to incidents, restore service after a critical incident, and provide recommendations to improve the supportability and availability. 3. Maintain, scale, planning and tuning the database. DBA required skillset:   * Data modelling and database design. The DBA must possess the ability to create an efficient physical database design from a logical data model and application specifications. If the data resource management discipline has not been created, the DBA also must be responsible for data modelling, normalization, and conceptual and logical design. * Database schema creation and management. A DBA must be able to translate a data model or logical database design into an actual physical database implementation and to manage that database once it has been implemented. * Backup and recovery. Implementing robust backup and recovery procedures is the insurance policy of the DBA. The DBA must implement an appropriate database backup and recovery strategy based on data volatility and application availability requirements. * Ensuring data integrity. DBAs must be able to design databases so that only accurate and appropriate data is entered and maintained. To do so, the DBA can deploy multiple types of database integrity including entity integrity, referential integrity, check constraints, and database triggers. Furthermore, the DBA must ensure the structural integrity of the database. * Performance management and tuning. Dealing with performance: the DBA must be able to proactively monitor the database environment and to make changes to data structures, SQL, application logic or the DBMS subsystem to optimize performance. * Ensuring availability. Applications and data increasingly are required to be up and available 24x7. The DBA must be able to ensure data availability using non-disruptive administration tactics. * SQL code reviews and walk-thru. The DBAs must possess in-depth SQL knowledge so they can understand and review SQL and host language programs and to recommend changes for optimization. * Capacity planning. As data consumption and usage continue to grow, the DBA must be prepared to support more data, more users, and more connections. The ability to predict growth based on application and data usage patterns and to implement the necessary database changes to accommodate the growth is a core capability of the DBA. This is the most important skill for the client's growing business. * General database management. The DBA is the central source of database knowledge in the organization. As such he must understand the basic tenets of relational database technology and be able to accurately communicate them to others. * Web-specific technology expertise. DBAs are required to have knowledge of Internet and Web technologies to enable databases to participate in Web-based applications. * Storage management techniques. The data stored in every database resides on disk somewhere (unless it is stored on one of the new main memory DBMS products). DBAs must understand the storage hardware and software, including how it interacts with the DBMS. Desired skillset:   * Previous working experience with Application Support Teams. Experience with ticketing systems and methodologies. * Proven experience in managing enterprise ERP applications. * Strong Linux SysAdmin skills: knowledge of the LAPP Stack (Linux, Apache, PHP, Postgres). * Experience in maintaining/monitoring/testing complex web applications. Knowledge of Web Services and Services Oriented Architecture is desirable. * Database management: SQL skills + DBA skills (backup/recovery/monitoring/scaling database servers). * Experience with SOX compliance and methodologies. * Ability to effectively interface with technical and nontechnical staff at all organizational levels. * Ability to learn new content areas and new skills quickly and well required. * Professional attitude and work habits.

Number of positions:   1 Salary Range:   TBD Job Location:   TBD Job description:   Client is one of the leading global cloud networking provider to multinational clients and is looking for a DBA/Software Support Specialist to join the Operations and Systems team. The successful candidate will be responsible for the day to day operations and maintenance of a business critical ERP application and its underlying systems architecture and database. The candidate has 3 main objectives:   1. On a daily basis the candidate will provide technical support for a business critical application managing the support tickets and solve the issues within the agreed SLAs. 2. On a daily basis you will monitor the environment health and performance, respond to incidents, restore service after a critical incident, and provide recommendations to improve the supportability and availability. 3. Maintain, scale, planning and tuning the database. DBA required skillset:   * Data modelling and database design. The DBA must possess the ability to create an efficient physical database design from a logical data model and application specifications. If the data resource management discipline has not been created, the DBA also must be responsible for data modelling, normalization, and conceptual and logical design. * Database schema creation and management. A DBA must be able to translate a data model or logical database design into an actual physical database implementation and to manage that database once it has been implemented. * Backup and recovery. Implementing robust backup and recovery procedures is the insurance policy of the DBA. The DBA must implement an appropriate database backup and recovery strategy based on data volatility and application availability requirements. * Ensuring data integrity. DBAs must be able to design databases so that only accurate and appropriate data is entered and maintained. To do so, the DBA can deploy multiple types of database integrity including entity integrity, referential integrity, check constraints, and database triggers. Furthermore, the DBA must ensure the structural integrity of the database. * Performance management and tuning. Dealing with performance: the DBA must be able to proactively monitor the database environment and to make changes to data structures, SQL, application logic or the DBMS subsystem to optimize performance. * Ensuring availability. Applications and data increasingly are required to be up and available 24x7. The DBA must be able to ensure data availability using non-disruptive administration tactics. * SQL code reviews and walk-thru. The DBAs must possess in-depth SQL knowledge so they can understand and review SQL and host language programs and to recommend changes for optimization. * Capacity planning. As data consumption and usage continue to grow, the DBA must be prepared to support more data, more users, and more connections. The ability to predict growth based on application and data usage patterns and to implement the necessary database changes to accommodate the growth is a core capability of the DBA. This is the most important skill for the client's growing business. * General database management. The DBA is the central source of database knowledge in the organization. As such he must understand the basic tenets of relational database technology and be able to accurately communicate them to others. * Web-specific technology expertise. DBAs are required to have knowledge of Internet and Web technologies to enable databases to participate in Web-based applications. * Storage management techniques. The data stored in every database resides on disk somewhere (unless it is stored on one of the new main memory DBMS products). DBAs must understand the storage hardware and software, including how it interacts with the DBMS. Desired skillset:   * Previous working experience with Application Support Teams.
